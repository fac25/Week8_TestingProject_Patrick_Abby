## User stories
#### As a busy person, I want to:<br>
📍Add tasks to a list so that I can keep track of them <br>
📍Check things off my list so that I can see what I’ve done <br>
📍Delete things from the list if I don’t need to do them anymore <br>
#### As a motor-impaired user, I want to:
📍Use all the features of the app without a mouse<br>
#### Stretch
📍Filter out completed to-dos from my list so that I can focus on what’s left to do
